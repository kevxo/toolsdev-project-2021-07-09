# Temperature Data of Austin HQ

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kevxo/toolsdev-project-2021-07-09.svg?branch=charts)](https://travis-ci.com/kevxo/toolsdev-project-2021-07-09) ![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=austin-weather-charts)





## Description:
  - Using a [Weather API](https://www.worldweatheronline.com/developer/api/), I created a Rails application where I collect data from a given location and retrieve the historical and current temperatures. With the use of Fast json, I'm able to build an API where I can call from the Front End. With AJAX I can make these calls to the APIs I created and with Highstock I can graph the data collected in two charts. One chart for historical weather and current weather, hourly intervals. Next chart chart for historical highs and lows, in 3-hour intervals. I also made use of a Postgres with saving historical data. Styling used for the project was Bootstrap. Deployment through Heroku.
